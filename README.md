# Week 10

## Mongoose

### Question #1

Describe the differences between a SQL and NoSQL database, and when you might use each.

```text
A SQL database is a relational database that follows a more rigid structure and requires schemas/ stores data in tables, while a NoSQL database is non-relational, is organized into documents and collections, and allows for greater flexibility. NoSQL databases scale out better than relational databases and are preferred for web applications, while SQL databases are preferred for enterprises because of better security models and mature data storage.
```

### Question #2

What's wrong with this Mongoose code and how might we fix it?

```js
var results = AuthorModel.find({name: "Bob"});
console.log(results);
```

> Hint: Assuming there is a document with a name of "Bob", why does `results` not contain an author model on the second line?

```js
The Mongoose queries are asynchronous, so we want to include a callback that will print the author model to the console, to ensure that the query has finished first.

AuthorModel.find({name: "Bob"}, (results) => {
  console.log(results);
})
```

### Question #3

Convert the Ruby and ActiveRecord code below into Javascript and Mongoose code:

```rb
@andy = Instructor.find_by(name: "Andy")
@andy.wishlist_items.create(description: "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold")
```

```js
// Your answer...
```

### Question #4

Convert the following create method in Mongoose to ActiveRecord.

```js
var author = new Author({name: req.body.name})
author.save(function(err){
  if (!err){
    res.redirect("authors")
  }
})
```

```rb
# Your answer...
```

### Question #5

What is module.exports and why do we use it?

```

### Question #6

Write one Express route for each of the four HTTP methods.

Then, make each route respond with a one-word string containing the RESTful action that would most likely be associated with this route.

```js
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

// Your code starts here...

```

### Question #7

Describe the differences between Express and Rails as backend frameworks.

### Question #8

What do the following lines of code do?

```js
var bodyParser = require("body-parser")
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))
```

```text
Your answer...
```
